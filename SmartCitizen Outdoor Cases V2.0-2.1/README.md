These are examples of some outdoor cases for the SCK with a PMS5003 sensor. You will find full 3D printed solutions, or some more complex solutions to be milled in a CNC on plastic.

## Recommendations

We give some recommendations for each enclosure's fabrication process in each design's folder.

Keep in mind that no enclosure is perfect and that it will not compensate fully sun radiation and/or humidity extremes. All the enclosures in this folder have been tested, but keep in mind that outdoor conditions can be unpredictable.
